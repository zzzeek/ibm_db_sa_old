===============================================================================
IBM_DB_SA 0.2.1 (2013/01/26) implementing SQLAlchemy version 0.7/0.8
===============================================================================

The IBM_DB_SA adapter provides the Python/SQLAlchemy interface to IBM
Data Servers.

This version is all new for version 0.8 of SQLAlchemy and will also work
with version 0.7.

Prerequisites
=============
1. Python 2.5.x or greater.  Jython and Pypy are compatible in theory.
2. SQLAlchemy 0.7.3 or above
3. IBM_DB driver and IBM_DB_DBI wrapper 1.0.1 or higher (ibm_db-1.0.5 is
   a minimum) for Python, or db2jcc.jar and db2jcc_license_cu.jar for Jython
4. Optional ClientAccess ODBC Driver, or jt400.jar and util400.jar for
   Jython to connect to DB2 for iSeries

Installation
============
Standard Python setup should be used:

  python setup.py install

Connecting
===========

  1. Using default ibm_db driver
      ibm_db_sa://user:passwd@address:port/database

  2. Using alternate pyodbc driver
      ibm_db_sa+pyodbc://user:passwd@address:port/database

  3. Special for Jython
      ibm_db_sa+zxjdbc://user:passwd@address:port/database

  4. Using alternate pyodbc driver to connect to DB2 for i
      ibm_db_sa+pyodbc400://user:passwd@address:port/database

  5. Special for Jython to connect to DB2 for i
      ibm_db_sa+zxjdbc400://user:passwd@address:port/database


Supported Databases
===================
  - IBM DB2 Universal Database for Linux/Unix/Windows versions 9.7 onwards
  - Remote connections to i5/OS (iSeries)
  - Remote connections to z/OS (DB2 UDB for zOS), only by default ibm_db drivers
